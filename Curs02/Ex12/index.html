    <p>
      In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk,
      supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the
      definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with
      secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a
      specified height.
