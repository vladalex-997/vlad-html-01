    <p>
      Berlin, Germanyâ€™s capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of the
      city's turbulent 20th-century history include its Holocaust memorial and
      the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during the Cold War, its
      18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of reunification. The
      city's also known for its art scene and modern landmarks like the
      gold-colored, swoop-roofed Berliner Philharmonie, built in 1963.

      The cat is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species
      in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to
      distinguish it from wild members of the family. The cat is either a house
      cat or a farm cat, which are pets, or a feral cat, which ranges freely and
      avoids human contact
