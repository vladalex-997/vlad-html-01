      Berlin, Germanyâ€™s capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of the
      city's turbulent 20th-century history include its Holocaust memorial and
      the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during the Cold War, its
      18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of reunification. The
      city's also known for its art scene and modern landmarks like the
      gold-colored, swoop-roofed Berliner Philharmonie, built in 1963.
